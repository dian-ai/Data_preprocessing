# Data_preprocessing
From the online course at udemy ' DeepLearning from A-Z : Hands on Artificial Neural Networks'
This course is structured and explained with Scikit-learn 0.2 I guess.
At the time of my study Scikit-learn were upgraded to 0.22 therefore some commands has been changed.
I upgraded the course material for myself and left it public for anyone in need.
I also added all the notes I took during the online lectures.
